# BQN solutions for Advent of Code 2025

Solutions are organized into directories corresponding to the AoC day. Each
directory contains `main.bqn` with the solution, which expects to have `sample`
and `input`, corresponding to the example input for the day, and the full input,
respectively (Some problems may require slightly different filenames, read the
source code to know for sure). Tested using CBQN
